#observation: 
1. using the data from VOC2007, the network would converge at around epoch 10.


##Date: 10/18/2018

#done:
1. understand the file structure;
2. add average score to validation step.

#try:
1. deal with the anchor boxes since the locations seem to affect the outcome;
2. download dac dataset, can grab a small portion for training and validation each time;
3. derive the detailed structure of feature extraction step as well as three scales.

#try:
1. reading materials about anchor boxes (and scales), might come up with something espeically for human
